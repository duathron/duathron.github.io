# About

Technology has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. A Game Boy at four.
A self-built 486 at twelve – assembled from spare parts salvaged from my parents'
office, running DOS and Windows 95. As a teenager, I was the one managing the network
infrastructure of my parents' company and organising LAN parties with friends, long
before any of us had a driver's licence.

The passion was always there. Life, however, had other plans.

I ended up in photography – and I committed to it fully. I completed my apprenticeship
as the top graduate of my regional photographers' guild, before going on to earn a
Bachelor of Arts with a final grade of 1.0. What kept me engaged wasn't just the visual
craft. Photography is a deeply technical profession that demands constant adaptation:
evolving camera systems, complex colour science, and workflows built around mastering
specialised tools at a professional level. Over the years I developed deep expertise
in **Adobe Photoshop** – working at the level of high-end retouching and multi-layer
compositing, where precision and an understanding of how the tool thinks are everything
– and in **Capture One**, a platform that rewards those who understand colour,
calibration, and RAW processing at a fundamental level rather than a surface one.
Alongside still photography, I expanded into video production, audio engineering, and
aerial cinematography, holding a certified EU drone pilot licence (class A2).

Since 2014, I've worked as a freelance commercial photographer for corporate clients
and enterprises across Germany and beyond. Precision, discretion, and delivering under
pressure are not skills I'm still developing – they're the foundation I bring with me.

In November 2025, I made a decision: to stop ignoring where my instincts have always
pointed and take the technical curiosity that has driven every chapter of my life
seriously – as a profession. Since then, I've been learning consistently: evenings,
weekends, alongside a full-time freelance career and family life with a young child.
Not the easiest conditions. But the motivation has never been the question.

## What I'm working on

I'm currently active on **TryHackMe**, working through structured learning paths with
a focus on SOC and offensive security fundamentals. In parallel, I'm building a solid
technical foundation in **Python** and IT support via Google's IT Support Professional
Certificate on Coursera.

## Certifications

- ✅ **SEC1** – Security Fundamentals *(TryHackMe, 2025)*
- 🔄 **SOC Analyst Level 1** – In progress *(TryHackMe)*
- 🔄 **Google IT Support Professional Certificate** – In progress *(Coursera)*
- 🎯 **CompTIA Security+** – Planned

## Why this blog

This blog documents the journey – CTF writeups, learning notes, tools I'm exploring,
and honest reflections on what it takes to break into cybersecurity with a non-traditional
background. If you're on a similar path, I hope it's useful. If you're a recruiter
or hiring manager, feel free to reach out.
